### Hello there üëãüèΩ, I'm Shaan Sapra


I‚Äôm currently working on a Kubernetes operator for MySQL at VMware. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SQL-with-MySQL-for-Kubernetes/index.html) if you're interested to learn more.

I'm primarily a backend engineer, focusing on implementing business logic. However, I've worked on several React projects and really enjoyed learning how to use components and hooks to build complex user interfaces.

Since joining Pivotal in 2018, I've been practicing pair-programming and test-driven development. It has allowed me to learn so much from peers while also writing great software. 

Some of my favorite blog posts or resources that I've collected over the years:
